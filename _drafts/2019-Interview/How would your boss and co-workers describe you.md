# How would your boss and co-workers describe you?

My boss usually had a one on one meeting with me every month. Based on his comments and feedback, I believe he would describe me in the following way:


1. I am passionate about programming. I did get a master's degree in medicine and I do have the qualifications to be a doctor. However I changed my career from medicine to programming because I have a passion for programming, and I enjoy writing technology articles, organizing meetup and building relationships with other programmers.

2. I am a diligent worker. I have a habit of getting to the office 3 hours early, in order to read computer science books, do research and review what I have learned.

3. I am someone who is goal-oriented. 

I am good at creating plans to achieve a goal.

for example:

In the beginning of every year, I will set a goal and break it down into smaller concrete tasks. If you are interested, you can checkout examples of my work in my GitHub repository.

Every Monday morning, I set a goal for the week and review my work from last week.

4. I am a not a people person. I work best when the office is quiet and nobody interrupts me. That’s not to say that I hate communication or building relationships. on the contrary, I love building relationships with my colleagues —— and helping them when they have to deal with some hard problem.


## Weaknesses

Conflict makes me uncomfortable.

In the workplace, in church, and in whatever public place, I believe people should be nice, show kindness and love to each other, and try their best to understand others.

When collaborating with my co-workers, I sometimes have difficulty asserting myself even though I am often right.
