# Can you tell me a little about yourself?

Well, my name is Ryan, I graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University, and my major was clinical medicine.

My career so far has been quite a journey.

My first job was as a medical product manager, and in that job I had two roles.

First, As a product manager, my job was to build a medical research database, and deliver a new mobile App product.

Second, I led the data team to collect, clean, and organize disease and drug data to meet the requirements of other departments.

I was in that position for two years, and during those two years, I learned programming.

Then, I moved to shanghai for personal reasons and started my new career in programming. I worked for a startup company as a ruby developer. 

I implemented lots of features for the company's E-commerce system. For example, the delivery sub-system and the SMS notification.

That company had twenty million customers at that time, so I also do some performance tuning work


I worked there for a year and a half. During part of that time, my wife was pregnant. It was a greater challenge to balance my work and family.

Then I joined SAP's Jam team. it's a global team, which is based in 3 locations, shanghai, Canada, US.

In the beginning, I worked as a backend developer, implementing new features, writing Restful APIs for the mobile client, and so on.

Two years later, I got a chance to work as a fellow in the infrastructure team for 8 months, implementing some features for application performance monitoring tools, and doing some performance tuning work.

During that period, I successfully reduced the web server spike response time from 300 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds.

After my fellowship ended, there was a re-organization within our team. The Shanghai team took on all the responsibility for this product. I became a DevOps engineer, and started to handle things relating to infra and ops. Those included SQL review, certificate updates, maintaining the distributed test system and migrating data from one datacenter to another.

I worked at SAP Jam team for more than four years. 

That's been my career so far.
