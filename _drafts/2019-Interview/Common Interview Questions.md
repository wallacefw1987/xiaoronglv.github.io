## 2. How did you hear about the position?

There is a podcast called teahour, hosted by several ruby developers. they usually invite some famous developers and have an interview with them.

If my memory serves, Huangdongxu has been invited in 2017. In that talk, he said he is inspired by Spanner and going to build a distributed database system.

At that moment, I know PingCAP and started to keep an eye on it.

I also subscribed to your blog and WeChat. 

I almost attend all your meetups in shanghai.

that’s how i know this position.


## 3. What do you know about the company?


Regarding technology, I just got a high-level understanding of TiDB.

**TiDB**

First, TiDB is a distributed database system. Developer doesn't have to partition their database when their data grows rapidly.


Second, it's a hybrid transaction analytical database.

TiSpark takes responsibility for OLAP, it takes advantage of Raft learner to sync data from OLTP to OLAP.


**TiKV**

Another component is TiKV, which is a distributed key-value database.


**PD** 

PD is used to manage and schedule the TiKV cluster.

Regarding the business, I know some bank has already using TiDB as their OLTP database.



## 4. Why do you want this job?

First of all, I love the database. When I'm saying I love it, it means, I spent a lot of time to study database. usually, I arrive office at 7:30 and spend 2 hours on it every day.

for example 

I read < High-performance MySQL> twice 

and I also read <Design data intensive application>

I have learn a lot about database concepts, isolation, mvcc, database recovery, checkpoint, locks, raft.

I am trying to find a database company. Google spanner, Percona, MongoDB, that's impossible. I have married, also I have a kid. 

When I know PingCAP, I realize that it's the company that I want to work for.
