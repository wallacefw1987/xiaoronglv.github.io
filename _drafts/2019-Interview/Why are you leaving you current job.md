# Why are you leaving you current job?

(direct I am leaving the position because I am looking for new challenges)

SAP is a great place to work. 

1. I really appreciate that it provided good work life balance when I became a father.

2. And it allowed me to dive into a specific field of computer science.

for example, I spent lots of time on database, reading books, documentation and blogs, as well as attending many conferences.

I was a database specialist /'spɛʃəlɪst/ in my team, and I really enjoyed it.

3. my colleagues were very nice, we had a good relationship with each other.

To be honest, I really appreciate it.

However, I am looking for new challenges in my career.

Meanwhile, there are also disadvantages

1. people in large company are assigned to a specific position. it's not easy to do some topics that belongs to other team.

2. The technology are old fashioned.

2. Big companies are usually very slow.

However, I often ask one question. If there are only 2 years left in my life, which kind of life should I live?

This question helps me to reflect on what is important in my life. my faith to god, my family, health. but when it comes to career, I need to do some changes. To build something that I have great passion, and I am ready to go forward.



Option2

The product SAP Jam has been announced to be maintenance mode, it will be retired in the following two years.

And I have no interests to be re-allocated to another SAP team.
